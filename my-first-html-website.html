                <p>
                    ‚ÄúAngel‚Äôs Egg‚Äù is a Japanese art film original video animation (OVA)
                    directed by Mamoru Oshii and released in 1985. The story follows an
                    unnamed young girl living alone in a decaying Neo-Gothic/Art Nouveau
                    cityscape. She cares for a mysterious large egg while scavenging for
                    survival. The film features minimal dialogue and a strongly allegorical
                    narrative, leaving many viewers puzzled by its meaning.
